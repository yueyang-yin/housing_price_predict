# House Price Prediction

This repository contains an **end-to-end machine learning practice project** for residential house price prediction. The primary goal of the project is to practice data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and basic ML engineering workflows.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**
> This project is created **for learning and practice purposes only**.
> The models, results, and conclusions presented here **should not be used as a reference for real-world decision-making, investment analysis, or commercial applications**.

## Project Overview

The project covers the complete pipeline of a typical supervised learning task:

* Data cleaning and exploratory analysis
* Feature engineering and transformation
* Model comparison and selection
* Final model training using XGBoost with early stopping
* End-to-end inference from raw input data

A detailed technical report describing the modeling process, evaluation metrics, and example predictions is provided separately.

📄 **Full technical report**: [report/README.md](report/README.md)

## Reproducibility (Quick Start)

To reproduce the training and inference results locally, ensure that the required environment is installed. For detailed environment requirements, please refer to [report/README.md](report/README.md).

### Train the model

```bash
python model/src/train.py
```

### Run prediction

```bash
python model/src/predict.py --input data/raw_input.csv --mode raw
```

All trained models, feature definitions, and evaluation metrics are stored under `model/artifacts/`.
